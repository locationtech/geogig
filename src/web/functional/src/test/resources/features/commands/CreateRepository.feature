Feature: Create Repository
  Creating a repository on the server is done through the "/repos/{repository}/init" command
  The command must be executed using the HTTP PUT method
  If a repository with the provided name already exists, then a 409 "Conflict" error code shall be returned
  If the command succeeds, the response status code is 201 "Created"

  Scenario: Verify wrong HTTP method issues 405 "Method not allowed"
    Given There is an empty multirepo server
    When I call "GET /repos/repo1/init"
    Then the response status should be '405'
    And the response allowed methods should be "PUT"

  Scenario: Verify trying to create an existing repo issues 409 "Conflict"
    Given There is a default multirepo server
    And I have "extraRepo" that is not managed
    When I "PUT" content-type "application/json" to "/repos/extraRepo/init" with
      """
      {
        "parentDirectory":"{@systemTempPath}"
      }
      """
    Then the response status should be '409'
    And the response ContentType should be "application/xml"
    And the xpath "/response/success/text()" equals "false"
    And the xpath "/response/error/text()" equals "Cannot run init on an already initialized repository."
