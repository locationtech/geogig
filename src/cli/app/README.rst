GeoGig CLI Module
#################

This is the CLI (Command Line Interface) module for GeoGig.

The GeoGig CLI module produces a Java program to run command line geogig commands.

Build
*****

Run::

   $mvn install package 

To create a binary assembly with ready to use bash and windows scripts under ``target/geogig``.

The ``bin`` directory inside ``target/geogig`` has a ``bin`` folder with the batch scripts to directly invoke geogig commands without dealing with Java classpath settings and other arguments.

The ``repo`` directory inside ``target/geogig`` contains all the needed dependencies. Is is generated by the `maven appassembler <http://mojo.codehaus.org/appassembler/appassembler-maven-plugin/>`_ plugin.


The ``appassembler`` plugin is configured to run automatically on the ``package`` life cycle, as the ``package`` goal is a pre-requisite for ``appassembler`` to correctly resolve all needed dependencies. But you can also run ``mvn appassembler:assemble`` to just create the binary assembly provided ``mvn package`` has been run already.

Run
***

::

   $export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/target/geogig/bin
   $chmod +x target/geogig/bin/*
   $geogig --help
   $geogig init target/testrepo
   $cd target/testrepo
   $geogig status
   
and so on.

Getting command help
********************

``geogig help <command>`` will invoke the UNIX manual page (man(1)) for the given command.

Check the docs at ``../../doc/manpages`` for more info.

In a nutshell::

   $cd ../../doc/manpages
   $make clean man
   $export MANPATH=$MANPATH:`pwd`/build
   $man geogig
   $man geogig-init

etc.
