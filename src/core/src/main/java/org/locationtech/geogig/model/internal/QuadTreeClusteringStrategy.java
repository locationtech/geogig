/**
 * This class determines how the quadtree clustering strategy puts features in the tree.
 *
 * NOTE: This also supports polygons/lines (i.e. non-point objects). Each feature is only put in ONE
 * location in the tree - the quad that it is fully enclosed by (which might be the root node).
 *
 * NOTE: if the feature doesn't have a bounds (i.e. null or empty), then it is NOT put in the tree
 * (null QuadTreeNodeId).
 *
 * The main entry point is computeId(), which returns a QuadTreeNodeId that defines where that Node
 * should be in the QuadTree. The QuadTreeNodeId contains a list of Quandrants defining which
 * quadrant the feature lies completely inside for EACH level of the quadtree.
 *
 * If QuadTreeNodeId contains quadrants NE, then SE, then NW then it means that:
 *
 * The feature is completely in the NE quadrant for the "world" (level 0).
 *
 * Looking at the world's NE quadrant and subdividing it into 4 quads, the feature would be fully in
 * the SE quadrant (level 1).
 *
 * The world's NE quadrant (level 0), then that quad's sub SE quadrant (level 1), the feature will
 * be contains in that quad's NW quad (level 2).
 *
 * This continues until; + the max depth of the tree is reached + the feature in not fully contained
 * in a single quad
 *
 * Typically, large features will need to be contained "higher" up in the tree. However, this can
 * happen with very small features that are "unlucky" enough to cross ANY quad boundary. If this
 * happens a lot, then the tree could become more degenerative and have large numbers of features
 * associated with a single node that can NOT be moved into "lower" level nodes in the hierarchy.
