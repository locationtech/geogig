/**
 * This is a simple producer-consumer based Iterator that pulls using a background thread.
 * 
 * This uses a BlockingQueue to store a fixed number of items. As soon as you construct this
 * BackgroundingIterator, a thread will start that will start pulling items from the underlying
 * iterator.
 * 
 * The BlockingQueue will block the pulling thread when the queue gets full. hasNext()/next() will
 * block if there are no available items and wait while the pulling thread gets another item.
 * 
 * This is useful for iterators that access file/database items as they can be sped-up greatly by
 * using a pull thread.
 * 
 * A PoisonPill is put onto the queue to signify that there are no more items.
 *
 * If the underlyingIterator throws an exception, then;
 *    + if the queue has space, the PoisonPill (with error) is set.
 *    + If the queue is full, then it will BE EMPTIED to ensure the PoisonPill is immediately put
 *       on the queue so the producer can terminate.
