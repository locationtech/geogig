GeoGig - Geospatial Distributed Version Control System
======================================================

Welcome to the GeoGig project, exploring the use of distributed management of spatial data. GeoGig draws inspiration from [Git](http://git-scm.com/), but adapts its core concepts to handle versioning of geospatial data. Users are able to import raw geospatial data (currently from Shapefiles, PostGIS or SpatiaLite) in to a repository where every change to the data is tracked. These changes can be viewed in a history, reverted to older versions, branched in to sandboxed areas, merged back in, and pushed to remote repositories. GeoGig is written in Java, available under the BSD License.

<!-- For background reading see these two papers on the spatial distributed versioning [Concept ](http://boundlessgeo.com/whitepaper/new-approach-working-geospatial-data-part-1/),  [Implementation](http://boundlessgeo.com/whitepaper/distributed-versioning-geospatial-data-part-2/), and [Potential Development](http://boundlessgeo.com/whitepaper/distributed-versioning-geospatial-data-part-3/). -->
