/**
 * A GeoGig revision tree is an immutable data structure that represents a
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle Tree</a> (or Hash Tree), holding
 * {@link TYPE#FEATURE feature} or {@link TYPE#TREE tree} {@link Node node} pointers to children
 * {@link RevTree} or {@link RevFeature} objects in an {@link ObjectStore}, and {@link Bucket}
 * pointers to point to subtrees it has been split into when a certain threshold on the allowed max
 * capacity of it's feature or tree lists has been surpased.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #getId() id} of a {@code RevTree} is computed out of its directly contained
 * {@link RevTree#trees() tree}, {@link RevTree#features() feature}, and {@link RevTree#getBuckets()
 * bucket} pointers as mandated by {@link HashObjectFunnels}.
 * <p>
 * Two trees that contain the same values hash out to the same {@link ObjectId}, as long as they
 * have been built using the same "clustering strategy". That is, the same limits to split a tree
 * into subtrees (buckets) and the same ordering of it's nodes have been applied. The two trees,
 * hence, will only differ in what have actually changed, as only the changed buckets, or the tree
 * itself if it holds nodes, will hash out to a different value, conforming a DAG (Directed Acyclic
 * Graph).
 * <p>
 * This data structure does not impose a split threshold nor a default ordering for nodes, allowing
 * the builder to create trees based on different criteria, depending on whether it'll be used to
 * represent a tree's canonical form, or an index of some form.
 * <p>
 * The <b>Canonical </b> structure of a {@code RevTree} is mandated by the
 * {@link CanonicalNodeNameOrder} {@link Comparator}, which also defines the per depth level
 * {@link CanonicalNodeNameOrder#normalizedSizeLimit(int) split threshold}.
 * <p>
 * The Canonical representation of a tree is the one that is used to store {@link RevTree} instances
 * in the repository, and is optimized for fast computation of differences between any two given
 * trees, as such is perhaps the most important operation in geogig.
 * <p>
 * Every geogig {@link RevCommit commit} points to a root tree, which in turn points to feature
 * trees, which in turn point to features and/or other, nested feature trees.
 * <p>
 * A "feature tree" node will have a {@link Node#getMetadataId() metadata id} that's a pointer to
 * the layer's default {@link RevFeatureType Feature Type}. Feature nodes that are children of such
 * trees that have a {@link ObjectId#NULL} metadata id are deemed to pertain the their parent tree's
 * feature type. The feature nodes that have a non {@link ObjectId#NULL} metadata id are deemed
 * pointers to {@link RevFeature features} that comply to a different feature type than the tree's
 * default.
 * <p>
 * That is, the object model allows for nested feature trees (a.k.a layers, feature classes), and
 * for a single feature tree to contain features of mixed feature types.
