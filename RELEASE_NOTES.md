GeoGig 1.1.0 Release Notes
==============================

May 10, 2017.

GeoGig 1.1 is now out for general consumption!

Stakeholders asked us to make GeoGig faster - and 1.1 is all about making things faster! Most importantly, we’ve added
the Spatial-Index-With-Attributes and greatly improved the networking, caching, and rendering performance.  We expect
that all users will see substantial performance improvements.

For existing GeoGig installations, see our detailed [Upgrade Guide](http://geogig.org/upgrade/index.html)
(which includes helpful tips for installations).

Download bundles are available [here](https://github.com/locationtech/geogig/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

### Release Overview:

This release introduces the long awaited spatial indexing capabilities to GeoGig.

GeoGig's spatial index can index the whole history of a repository's datasets. It was
developed from scratch to take advantage of geogig's core design principle to efficiently
store large amounts of features and quickly compute the differences between any two
snapshots, the Merkle Tree (a.k.a. Hash Tree), that allows us to create a DAG (Directed
Acyclic Graph) where each data snapshot is an entry point to the graph, while they share
all but what changes internally.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first spatial index that can effectively
work on such a graph of data.

When an index is created for a feature tree (i.e. layer), a new tree is created mirroring
the canonical tree contents, but using a quad-tree clustering strategy for its non terminal
nodes.

#### Spatial indexing capabilities:

* Indexes are automatically updated on commits. Create an index for a layer, and any operation
that creates a new commit will trigger the update of the index (i.e. commit, rebase, merge, etc).

* Materialized attributes: the spatial index can materialize any spatial or non spatial attribute
of the FeatureType being indexed, in order to speed up attribute queries as well as spatial ones.
For example, you might want to include the attributes needed by the Styled Layer Descriptor to properly
filter out Features for rendering on a WMS; or include the time/elevation attributes to speed up
queries on time series in GeoServer. 

* Spatial indexing command set: the geogig command line and its WEB API include a full set of
commands to manage the indexes. Run `geogig index --help` or browse the online documentation at
http://geogig.org/docs for more information.


#### Other improvements in this release:

* Better support for foreign CRS definitions. Importing from datasets that define its coordinate
reference system in non OGC WKT formats (e.g. most shapefiles) are now correctly matches to their
corresponding CRS from the EPSG database, providing extra CRS metadata such as area of validity.
* Better PostgreSQL backend caching. The PostgreSQL backend's internal cache uses an improved
serialization format that's a lot faster to decode, while still allowing to control the cache
size by storing serialized objects instead of Java objects.
* Performance improvements to internal threading.
* Fix a bug in updating quad-trees.
* Fix a bug when retrieving repository logs for very old ancestors with large numbers of commits.
* Enable and fix bugs around the ability to cancel many GeoGig operations.
* Fix a bug in export-diff where incorrect commit IDs were sometimes being used.
* Add and enhance concurrency testing.


#### The Spatial-Index-With-Attributes Index

</p>

The new GeoGig index (a revision-sharing QuadTree index) greatly improves performance for the two most common types of queries - spatial queries and attribute queries.

For spatial searches, the QuadTree organization of the index makes for efficient retrieval of features.

The most common types of attribute query (“only display Highway and Freeways”, “only display data marked between these two dates” ) is also optimized by storing Extra Attributes inside the QuadTree.  When executing the query, GeoGig can use the extra information in the index to quickly filter out unneeded features.

The end result is **much** faster query performance (and much less network traffic).

GeoGig 1.0.0 Release Notes
==========================

December 21, 2016.

The GeoGig team is proud to announce the graduation of Release Candidate 1.0-RC4 to 1.0!
Only one minor bug was found in RC4 (related to deriving its version) that needed to be 
fixed for the 1.0 release. Please see the Release Notes for RC4 below for more.

GeoGig 1.0-RC4 Release Notes
============================

December 19, 2016.

These are the release notes for the fourth GeoGig release candidate.

Five important things happended since 1.0-RC3 besides several bug fixes:

* First and foremost, the developer's team got three new memebers. Join us
to congratulate (and thank!) David Blasby, Morgan Thompson, and Alex Goudine
for becoming geogig committers and help us drive this project further and farther.

* We have cleared out all of our Intellectual Property checks on all our
dependencies and have now [LocationTech](https://locationtech.org/) blessing to perform
a sponsored release!
Thanks to LocationTech, Eclipse Foundation's geospatial branch, for their
continued support and commitment to the success of this and the other projects
under its umbrella.

* The new RevTreeBuilder infrastructure became mainstream. It replaces the
legacy tree builder in order to generate revision trees faster, create no
garbage in the objects database (the old one left dangling tree objects
increasing the database size unnecessarily), and perhaps more importantly,
enables the use of the same infrastructure to build spatial and attribute
indexes on revision graphs (yes, you'll be able to index all your data 
history, stay tunned).

* The PosgreSQL storage backend is now WAL and replication safe, by moving
to use B-Tree indexes instead of Hash indexes. Thanks David Blasby for the
thorough performance testing. 

* The default storage backend for local repositories now uses [Rocksdb](http://rocksdb.org/).
It's faster than the old BerkeleyDB Java Edition database, and produces
smaller databases on disk.
The BerkeleyDB storage backend was taken off the official build, but Boundless
still provides a separate plugin download, so if you have existing repositories
just download [the bdbje plugin](https://github.com/locationtech/geogig/releases/download/v1.0-RC4/geogig-plugins-bdbje-1.0-RC4.zip) and unzip it
under your `<geogig installation directory>/lib/` folder.

We are really really close to a first 1.0 official release now! Maybe even for Christmas!

GeoGig 1.0-RC3 Release Notes
============================

August 4, 2016.

These are the release notes for the third GeoGig release candidate.

We have worked hard since RC2 on fixing the last outstanding bugs that prevented 
a solid release, and focused on some performance improvements.

This release is also the official launch of the PostgreSQL storage backend [1],
which allows to store several repositories in a single postgres database.

Also, the GeoServer plugin is being released for GeoServer 2.8, 2.9, and 2.10 series,
with several improvements both on GUI [2] and REST [3] configuration.

[2] <http://geogig.org/docs/interaction/geoserver_ui.html>
[3] <http://geogig.org/docs/interaction/geoserver_web-api.html>

The next steps are a strong focus on performance and scalability and a final
1.0 release by the end of the year. Stay tuned and write us back with your 
feedback about this important milestone.
