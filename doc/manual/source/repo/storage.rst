Storage Back-ends
=================

GeoGig can store repository elements in different storage backends or databases.

There are currently two storage backends: one default backend for repositories in the local computer's file system, and the second is a PostgreSQL backend that stores all the repository data in a Postgres database.

Whether to use one or the other is a matter of choice and/or convenience. The default storage backend is recommended for single repositories, such as when you are working on a specific project in your local machine.

The PostgreSQL backend is recommended for server side deployments, such as a deployment where several repositories are served through GeoServer.

A common scenario is to have a remote GeoServer with several repositories that use the PostgreSQL backend to host them all, and a local clone of one of those repositories in your local machine, can take the local clone off-line or simply do work disconnected from the server, and then pull from and push changes to the remote repository.

Default storage backend
=======================

Up to 1.0-RC3, the default storage backend was a BerkeleyDB Java Edition key/value database for the main repository elements such as the revision and graph objects, and simple text files for configuration settings, refs, and merge conflicts.

As of 1.0-RC4, the BerkeleyDB database was replaced by a better performing database, RocksDB. Nonetheless, repositories created with the BerkeleyDB storage backend will still be supported through GeoGig's plug-in mechanism.

When a repository is created in the local filesystem, it uses a directory structure like the following:

.. code-block:: console

    user@localhost:/data/myrepository$ ls .geogig/ -F1
    config
    graph/
    HEAD
    hooks/
    log/
    objects/
    refs/
    STAGE_HEAD
    WORK_HEAD


In order to use the GeoGig command line for a specific local repository, you can either:

* Work inside the repository directory (the ``.geogig`` directory's parent), like in the example above;
* Use the ``--repo <path/to/repository>`` argument to the ``geogig`` command. e.g.: ``user@localhost:/home/user$ geogig --repo /data/myrepository log`` to list the commits in the current branch of the ``/data/myrepository`` repo.

PostgreSQL storage backend
==========================

Whilst the default storage backend can hold only one single repository per directory, the PostgreSQL storage backend is designed to host several repositories in the same database.

It stores everything that's needed in the database, making it "stateless" and hence the best choice for server deployments, since you can even have several GeoServer instances serving data from the same repositories, in a cluster-like deployment.

.. note::  The database DOES NOT need PostGIS. A plain PostgreSQL database is used as a pure key/value store for most needs. Beware that for performance reasons, PostgreSQL 9.4 or newer is recommended, since prior versions have a performance issue with hash indexing that has been fixed since.

PostgreSQL repository URI
-------------------------

Since a repository stored in PostgreSQL is stateless, as far as the local machine is concerned, you need to specify the repository location for every console command you want to execute against it.

This is done through a URI (Universal Resource Identifier) of the following form:

``postgresql://<server>[:<port>]/<database>[/<schema>]/<reponame>?user=<username>&password=<pwd>``

In the above URI scheme, parts enclosed between ``<>`` symbols are mandatory, and parts enclosed between ``[]`` symbols are optional. These symbols do not have to be written as part of the actual URI.

* ``<server>``: The PostgreSQL server host or IP address
* ``[:port]``: The TCP port number the server is listening to for connections. Defaults to ``5432`` if not provided.
* ``<database>``: The name of the database in the server where GeoGig will store the repositories
* ``<schema>``: The PostgreSQL database schema, defaults to ``public``
* ``<reponame``: The name of the GeoGig repository to create
* ``<username>``: The PostgreSQL user name to connect as
* ``<pwd>``: The PostgreSQL user's password to connect with

Examples:

The following commands create two repositories, ``gold`` and ``QA`` in the same ``geogig`` database of the ``dbserver`` PostgreSQL instance:

.. code-block:: console

 user@localhost:/home/user$ geogig --repo "postgresql://dbserver/geogig/master/gold?user=peter&password=secret" init

 user@localhost:/home/user$ geogig --repo "postgresql://dbserver/geogig/master/QA?user=peter&password=secret" init


Tired already of typing the repository URI?
A nice trick is to use environment variables instead:

.. code-block:: console

 user@localhost:/home/user$ export gold="postgresql://dbserver/geogig/master/gold?user=peter&password=secret"
 user@localhost:/home/user$ export QA="postgresql://dbserver/geogig/master/QA?user=peter&password=secret"

 user@localhost:/home/user$ geogig --repo $gold init
 user@localhost:/home/user$ geogig --repo $QA init

Performance Tuning
------------------

There are several configuration options for tuning the cacheing and threading of the PostgreSQL backend.  The following configuration options should be set in the global config of the database.

* ``postgres.maxConnections``: The maximum number of simultaneous idle and in-use connections to the database. Defaults to 10.
* ``postgres.threadPoolSize``: The number of threads that the object database should use.  Defaults to the number of processors available to the virtual machine, or 2, whichever is higher.
* ``postgres.bytecache.maxSize``: The maximum size of the object database cache in bytes. Defaults to 10% of the heap.
* ``postgres.bytecache.initialCapacity``: The minimum total size of the cache in bytes.  Defaults to 1,000,000 bytes.
* ``postgres.bytecache.concurrencyLevel``: Hint to indicate the desired number of concurrent updates without contention. Actual concurrency may vary based on internal structure. Defaults to 16.
* ``postgres.bytecache.expireSeconds``: If specified, cache entries will be removed after the given number of seconds have passed.  This is not set by default, so entries do not expire from the cache.

Additionally, each repository can be tuned by adjusting the batch size of ``GET`` and ``PUT`` requests by adjusting the following configuration options.

* ``postgres.getAllBatchSize``: The maximum number of objects to retrieve from the database in a single request. If the number of objects that need to be fetched exceed the batch size, the job will be split into multiple tasks that can be run on multiple threads, if they are available.
* ``postgres.putAllBatchSize``: The maximum number of objects to insert into the database in a single request. If the number of objects that need to be inserted exceed the batch size, the job will be split into multiple tasks that can be run on multiple threads, if they are available.

Database set up
---------------

GeoGig will create the necessary tables the first time it's used against a given database. However, the database and user/role must already exist in PostgreSQL. You can use a pre-existing PostgreSQL role with administrative access to an existing database or you can run the following steps and SQL script to create the GeoGig database and tables first.

.. code-block:: console

 user@localhost:/home/user$ su - postgres
 postgres@localhost: $ createdb geogig
 postgres@localhost: $ psql -d geogig -f geogig_postgres.sql
