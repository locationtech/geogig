Feature: MergeFeature
  The MergeFeature resource provides a method of merging two conflicting features and is supported through the "/repos/{repository}/repo/mergefeature" endpoint
  The command must be executed using the HTTP GET method

  Scenario: Verify wrong HTTP method issues 405 "Method not allowed"
    Given There is an empty repository named repo1
     When I call "GET /repos/repo1/repo/mergefeature"
     Then the response status should be '405'
      And the response allowed methods should be "POST"
      
  Scenario: MergeFeature outside of a repository issues 404 "Not found"
    Given There is an empty multirepo server
     When I call "POST /repos/repo1/repo/mergefeature"
     Then the response status should be '404'
      And the response ContentType should be "text/plain"
      And the response body should contain "Repository not found"
      
  Scenario: MergeFeature with no json payload issues a 400 status code
    Given There is an empty repository named repo1
     When I call "POST /repos/repo1/repo/mergefeature"
     Then the response status should be '400'
      And the response body should contain "Invalid POST data."
      
  Scenario: MergeFeature with an invalid json payload issues a 400 status code
    Given There is an empty repository named repo1
     When I "POST" content-type "text/plain" to "/repos/repo1/repo/mergefeature" with

     Then the response status should be '400'

  Scenario: MergeFeature without a feature issues a 400 status code
    Given There is an empty repository named repo1
