How to help
===========


Whether you can code or not, there are many ways in which you can contribute to the GeoGit project. Here are some ideas.


Communication
--------------

In all cases, communication with the GeoGit community and team is crucial, so make sure that you know the main ways to get in contact with other GeoGit users and developers

Discussion takes place on our `geogit google group <https://groups.google.com/a/opengeo.org/group/geogit/>`_. Please join and introduce yourself, we'd love to help, and to figure out ways for you to get involved.

There is also a GeoGit IRC channel on `freenode <http://freenode.net/>`_ (`#geogit <irc://irc.freenode.net/geoserver>`_). GeoGit developers can usually be found there.

You can (and should) use the above for all GeoGit-related subjects, so other people are away of your work with GeoGit and can help you and eventually handle your contributions to the project efficiently.


Testing
----------

If you are an user, testing is the best and most simple way of helping us improve GeoGit. Use GeoGit with your own datasets, and if you find something that can be improved or doesn't work as expected, `open a new issue <https://github.com/opengeo/GeoGit/issues/new>`_. Please, check first that the same problem has not been reported by another user, to avoid duplicated issues. 

Documenting
------------

You can also help us with the GeoGit documentation, improving it yourself, reporting errors/typos or pointing out areas where it could be improved. Documentation is handled in the same way as the GeoGit source code, using standard `GitHub workflows <https://help.github.com/categories/63/articles>`_. All GeoGit documentation is written using  ReStructuredText and can be found at https://github.com/opengeo/GeoGit/tree/master/doc/.


Developing
----------------

If you are a developer wanting to get involved, please, first read the `developers section <https://github.com/opengeo/GeoGit/blob/master/doc/technical/developers.rst>`_ for technical details about how to build and develop GeoGit.

If you want to contribute code to the project, you can do it using the GitHub *fork* and *pull request* workflow. The following are some things to take into account before sending a pull request.

- Include test case demonstrating functionality
- Contributions are expected to pass all tests and not break the build
- Include proper license headers on your contributed files

More information on this workflow and how to remotely collaborate in a project like GeoGit can be found at the `GitHub help page <https://help.github.com/categories/63/articles>`_

Issues to help out on are at our `issue tracker <https://github.com/opengeo/GeoGit/issues>`_.

In all cases, please let us know about your work in advance. Write to the GeoGit google group or talk to someone on the IRC channel, so we can better coordinate all efforts.

Our build is `actively monitored using Jenkins <http://ares.opengeo.org:8080/view/geogit/>`_.
