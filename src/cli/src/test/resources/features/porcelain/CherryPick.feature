Feature: "cherry-pick" command
    In order to select specific changes to bring to the current branch
    As a Geogig User
    I want to cherry pick several commits from other branches

  Scenario: Try to cherry pick several commits
    Given I have a repository
      And I have several branches
     When I run the command "cherry-pick branch1 branch2"
	 Then the response should contain "Too many commits specified."
	  And it should exit with non-zero exit code
      
  Scenario: Try to cherry pick a single commit
    Given I have a repository
      And I have several branches
     When I run the command "cherry-pick branch1"
      And I run the command "log"
     Then the response should contain "Commit3"
      And the response should not contain "Commit2"
      And the response should not contain "Commit4"
      And the response should contain "Commit5"
      And the response should contain "Commit1"
      
  Scenario: Try to cherry pick a nonexistent branch
    Given I have a repository
      And I have several branches
     When I run the command "cherry-pick nonexistent"
     Then the response should contain "Commit not found"
      And it should exit with non-zero exit code
     
  Scenario: Try to cherry pick without specifying any commits
    Given I have a repository
      And I have several branches
     When I run the command "cherry-pick"
     Then it should answer "No commits specified."
     
  Scenario: Try to cherry pick from an empty directory
    Given I am in an empty directory
     When I run the command "cherry-pick branch1"
     Then the response should start with "Not in a geogig repository"
      And it should exit with non-zero exit code
     
  Scenario: Try to cherry pick a commit that causes conflict
    Given I have a repository
      And I have conflicting branches
     When I run the command "cherry-pick branch1"
     Then the response should contain "CONFLICT: conflict in Points/Points.1"
      And it should exit with non-zero exit code
