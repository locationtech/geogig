    As a Geogig User
    I want to rebase my local commits onto an existing branch

  Scenario: Try to rebase one branch to a parent branch
    Given I have a repository
      And I have several branches
     When I run the command "rebase master branch1"
      And I run the command "log"
     Then the response should contain "Commit1"
      And the response should contain "Commit2"
      And the response should contain "Commit3"
      And the response should not contain "Commit4"
      And the response should contain "Commit5"
      
  Scenario: Try to rebase one branch to a parent branch
    Given I have a repository
      And I have several branches

     Then the response should contain "Commit1"
      And the response should not contain "Commit2"
      And the response should not contain "Commit3"
